    <p>We're people that love random trivia. We've always loved having random facts that we can pull out at any time and bug people with. Also if you're just having a plain boring day we hope to give you something to distract you from that and get you on the right path!</p>

    <p>Founded in 2017 Daily Fun Trivia is a website designed by Brandon Roughton during his time at Southeast Community College. At first this was just a project to keep his capstone grade from plummeting, it has now developed into something that he works his hardest on everyday to keep the people informed. Go over to the <a href="Contact.aspx">contact</a> information and shoot him an email if you really like his work, or have something that he could change.</p>
